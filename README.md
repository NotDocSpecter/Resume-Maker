# How to Use it/How it Works
You can start by first opening up the website . You'll be greeted with a page that looks something like this:


<img width="1265" alt="image" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oevD7QB6ReNkgYYTp9hp2pSGM-eP5xM3/view?usp=sharing">

On the left side of the page is where all you're inputs/information handlers are. You will enter any information there. On the right side is the live preview of your resume as you enter more information. When the page is first opened, nothing will show up, but as you start to enter more information, you'll see the resume slowly build itself. I'm going to go ahead and enter some filler text so you can see how it looks like:

Now you can start to see the resume come to life. As you start to type, the headings, styles, fonts, etc. will all start to show up (conditional rendering!). If you keep scrolling down, you'll see that there's a ton more inputs for things like entering job experiences, entering your education, and much more. It'll look something like this:

Now, I'm just going to go ahead and enter some information so that the entire resume is filled up. Here's how it'll look when everything is filled out:

So yeah, that's basically it. One last feature I decided to add for the fun of it was an "add job experiences" button. If you click on it, another set of inputs will be created so you can enter more job details/experiences since I realize that many people have multiple jobs/work experiences.
